Algo Labs a DSA Learning Hub is an interactive educational website designed to help students and enthusiasts learn Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in a structured and practical way.
Algo Labs combines theoretical understanding with hands-on coding, allowing learners to explore concepts deeply and apply them instantly.
The platform provides everything you need to master DSA — from lecture videos and notes to pseudo code, MIT-level resources, and live coding practice.

Algo Labs is fullfilled with:
Lecture Videos:
Watch detailed explanations and walkthroughs for each DSA topic to strengthen your core concepts.

Notes & MIT Lecture References:
Well-organized notes and additional MIT lecture materials to help you understand topics from both academic and practical perspectives.

Pseudo Code:
Simplified algorithm logic before jumping into real code — great for understanding flow and structure.

Practice Tests:
Assess your understanding with interactive quizzes and problem-solving exercises.

Online Compiler:
Write, compile, and execute your programs directly on the website.
Supports C, C++, Python, and Java.

Engaging Interface:
Clean and responsive UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enhanced with Spline animations for a smooth, modern experience.


This project aims to make DSA learning interactive, accessible, and practical.
It’s not just a collection of resources — it’s a guided learning environment that helps you move from theory to implementation smoothly.
Whether you’re a beginner exploring computer science or an interview aspirant polishing your skills, DSA Learning Hub gives you a solid foundation to grow.
